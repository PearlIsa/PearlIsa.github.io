    <h2>About Pearl</h2>
    <p> I'm all about diving into new ideas, losing myself in epic tales like The Wheel of Time, The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings or binge-watching old tv shows from The Big Bang Theory, Criminal Minds to Last Man Standing. </p>
    <p>Python and R, are my preferred tools for visualization and analysis, using them to solve complex data puzzles. Whether it's creating intuitive AI models or crafting insightful data narratives, I'm always up for a challenge. </p>
    <p> Data science comprises much more than algorithms to me. I am also committed to responsible AI. I have led workshops for postgraduate researchers and emphasize the importance of using generative AI ethically and in accordance with regulations in academic research. </p>
   <p> My skill extends to extracting and transforming raw data from sources like Dimensions.ai into compelling insights, showcased through interactive dashboards for stakeholders. I also developed a reinforcement learning model to navigate virtual racetracks, securing 5th place regionally in the AWS DeepRacer competition, demonstrating proficiency in algorithm optimization. </p>
   <p> My portfolio demonstrates my abilities, featuring projects that range from leveraging machine learning for early ASD diagnosis in toddlers to creating advanced image classifiers with CNNs. These projects highlight my skill in making complex data concepts accessible and engaging through visual storytelling. </p>

        <h3>Classification of Early Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Symptoms in Toddlers Using ML</h3>
        <p> In this project, I applied Machine Learning (ML) techniques to develop a model capable of classifying early ASD symptoms in toddlers. Utilizing demographic, behavioral, and medical data from the Q-Chat-10 survey, my objective was to address the critical challenge of early ASD diagnosis, aiming to to accurately distinguish ASD from non-ASD cases, facilitating timely interventions. </p>
       <p> I analyzed classification models such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF), leveraging their efficiency and reliability to improve the diagnostic process. This required meticulous data cleaning, feature engineering, and the use of ML model development techniques. Throughout this process, continuous learning and adaptation guided my efforts, ensuring the implementation of best practices in ML development, with their performance evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. This approach allowed for a detailed assessment of each model's effectiveness, ensuring the selection of the most accurate tool for ASD diagnosis. </p>
       <p> I optimized the dataset, by reducing dimensionality to improve model training efficiency. The SVM was selected for its excellence in handling diverse datasets and performing both linear and non-linear classifications. Meanwhile, the RF classifier was chosen for its robustness in dealing with complex datasets, enhancing prediction accuracy. The SVM model outperformed the RF model in terms of precision, recall, and overall accuracy. </p>

        <h3>Data Analysis for Housing Features and Prices with R</h3>
        <p>The goal of this project was to use R to analyze the impact of various housing features on sale prices. The dataset included a variety of property information, like the number of rooms, bathrooms, and kitchens, as well as specific features like solar power, wood flooring, and security measures. Using R libraries like dplyr, caret, rsq, ggplot2, and ggcorrplot, I performed extensive data pre-processing and analysis to accurately predict housing prices. </p>
       <p>This analysis was based on two predictive models: a linear regression and an XGBoost model. The linear regression model outperformed expectations, with an adjusted R-squared value of 1, indicating that it could explain 100% of the variance in housing prices. The XGBoost model performed admirably, despite being slightly less accurate. </p>
<p>I used ggplot2 to create histograms and scatter plots, offering visual insights into the model's predictions compared to actual prices. These visual tools confirmed the model's efficacy, with most predicted prices aligning closely with actual values. </p>
